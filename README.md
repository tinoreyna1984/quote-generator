## Overview

![screenshot](./public/screenshot.png)

This is a quote generator. The following stories are fulfilled:
* You can see a random quote.
* You can generate a random quote.
* A quote goes with its genre.
* If you click on the author, you can see all of his quotes. Initially limited to 10, but there is a button below the list to fetch more quotes until reaching the total quotes from the author.
* Improvement TODO: after fetching, render partially any fetched quotes without loading again the list (the API paginates the quotes list).
